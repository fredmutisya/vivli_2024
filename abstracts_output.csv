Recurring food source-based Listeria outbreaks in the United States: An unsolved puzzle of concern?,"Recurring Listeria outbreaks in the United States is a growing public healthcare concern. Although no associated reported death, 17 were hospitalized out of the 18 reported illnesses in the recent outbreak in 15 US states. The United States has experienced about 30 Listeria outbreaks in the last decade with 524 Listeriosis cases and 80 deaths. The identified origin were ice cream, leafy greens, mushroom, meat slice, dairy products like cheese, packaged salads, cooked chicken, hard-boiled egg, pork product, frozen vegetable, raw milk, packaged caramel apple, bean sprout and soya products. Although rare, Listeria may lead to serious illness (invasive listeriosis) or death. Listeriosis is critically harmful and medically complicated, especially in the pregnant, the old above 65 years and in the immunocompromised. It could cause premature birth, miscarriage or even neonatal death. Hospitalization is often necessary in the geriatric, being fatal at times. Among Listeria sp., Listeria monocytogenes is often human infection-associated. It is a gram-positive, non-sporulating, motile bacillus opportunistic pathogen. Food-borne listeriosis is often associated with frozen foods due to its ability to thrive at low temperatures. Hypervirulent strains of L. monocytogenes with an ability to infect the respiratory system (the lungs) was recently reported in the coronavirus disease-19 patients during the pandemic. L. monocytogenes seemed to have developed antimicrobial resistance to ciprofloxacin and meropenem, possibly acquired through the food chain. An early onset of listeriosis in the newborn is evident in the first 7 days postparturition. As the bacteria colonize the genitourinary tract, majority of such cases result from teratogenic transfer during vaginal delivery. Premature newborns, neonates born outside healthcare facilities and low-birth-weight babies were increasingly predisposed to an early onset of listeriosis. Listeria outbreaks were earlier reported in South Africa, Australia and Europe, with an unclear origin of the outbreaks. Social media updates about such outbreaks, the most likely food source, and measures to self-protect are suggested as preventive measures. The article deals on various such aspects related to listeriosis primarily originating from food, to ensure better public healthcare and human wellness.","Mohapatra RK, Mishra S, Tuglo LS, Sarangi AK, Kandi V, Al Ibrahim AA, Alsaif HA, Rabaan AA, Zahan MK",Health Sci Rep. 2024 Feb 4;7(2):e1863. doi: 10.1002/hsr2.1863. eCollection 2024 Feb.,2024
Positron Emission Tomography-Based Pharmacokinetic Analysis To Assess Renal Transporter-Mediated Drug-Drug Interactions of Antimicrobial Drugs.,"Transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are of concern in antimicrobial drug development, as they can have serious safety consequences. We used positron emission tomography (PET) imaging-based pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis to assess the effect of different drugs, which may cause transporter-mediated DDIs, on the tissue distribution and excretion of [(18)F]ciprofloxacin as a radiolabeled model antimicrobial drug. Mice underwent PET scans after intravenous injection of [(18)F]ciprofloxacin, without and with pretreatment with either probenecid (150 mg/kg), cimetidine (50 mg/kg), or pyrimethamine (5 mg/kg). A 3-compartment kidney PK model was used to assess the involvement of renal transporters in the examined DDIs. Pretreatment with probenecid and cimetidine significantly decreased the renal clearance (CL(renal)) of [(18)F]ciprofloxacin. The effect of cimetidine (-86%) was greater than that of probenecid (-63%), which contrasted with previously published clinical data. The kidney PK model revealed that the decrease in CL(renal) was caused by inhibition of basal uptake transporters and apical efflux transporters in kidney proximal tubule cells. Changes in the urinary excretion of [(18)F]ciprofloxacin after pretreatment with probenecid and cimetidine resulted in increased blood and organ exposure to [(18)F]ciprofloxacin. Our results suggest that multiple membrane transporters mediate the tubular secretion of ciprofloxacin, with possible species differences between mice and humans. Concomitant medication inhibiting renal transporters may precipitate DDIs, leading to decreased urinary excretion and increased blood and organ exposure to ciprofloxacin, potentially exacerbating adverse effects. Our study highlights the strength of PET imaging-based PK analysis to assess transporter-mediated DDIs at a whole-body level.","Hernandez-Lozano I, Mairinger S, Filip T, Lobsch M, Stanek J, Kuntner C, Bauer M, Zeitlinger M, Hacker M, Helbich TH, Wanek T, Langer O",Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2023 Mar 16;67(3):e0149322. doi: 10.1128/aac.01493-22.

"Extra-genital Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections with genetic mutations conferring ciprofloxacin resistance among men who have sex with men and transgender women in Lima, Peru.","BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) infections has caused great concern. Ciprofloxacin remains the empiric antimicrobial recommended to treat NG infections in Peru disregarding the susceptibility profile of circulating NG strains. We report the prevalence of individuals infected with NG strains presenting mutations in the gyrA gene that confers ciprofloxacin resistance. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive study assessing extragenital swab samples collected from a cohort of men who have sex with men and transgender women in Lima, Peru. Anal and pharyngeal NG positive swabs for Aptima Combo 2 assay (Hologic Inc., USA) were used for DNA extraction. We performed TaqMan real time PCR assays to detect a point mutation at codon Ser91 of the gyrase A (gyrA) gene. RESULTS: From 156 individuals who had at least one positive sample for NG reported by the Aptima assay, 80 individuals had at least one amplified DNA for the gyrA gene. We found that 67 of them (84.0%) were infected with a gyrA-mutated NG strain at the Ser91 codon. CONCLUSIONS: We report a high prevalence of gyrA mutation conferring ciprofloxacin resistance among individuals with extragenital NG infection. Empirical treatment of NG needs to be urgently updated in Peru in concordance with international guidelines.","Qquellon J, Vargas SK, Eguiluz M, Vasquez F, Durand D, Allan-Blitz LT, Konda KA, Ochoa TJ, Caceres CF, Klausner JD",Int J STD AIDS. 2023 Mar;34(4):245-250. doi: 10.1177/09564624221147326.

"The Duration of Antibiotics Prophylaxis at the Time of Catheter Removal after Radical Prostatectomy: Clinically Integrated, Cluster, Randomized Trial.","PURPOSE: Prophylactic antibiotics are routinely given at the time of catheter removal post-radical prostatectomy (RP). The low rate of infectious complications entails that large sample sizes are required for randomized controlled trials, a challenge given the cost of standard randomized controlled trials. We evaluated infectious complications associated with 1 vs 3 days of prophylactic antibiotics at the time of catheter removal post-RP using a novel, clinically integrated trial with randomization at the surgeon level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surgeons were cluster randomized for periods of 3 months to prescribe 1-day vs 3-day regimen of prophylactic antibiotics at the time of catheter removal. The primary end point was an infectious complication as routinely captured by nursing phone call within 10 days of catheter removal and defined as positive urine cultures (>/=10(5) CFU) and at least 1 of the following symptoms: fever (>38 degrees C), urgency, frequency, dysuria or suprapubic tenderness. RESULTS: A total of 824 patients were consented and underwent RP with, respectively, 389 and 435 allocated to 1-day and 3-day antibiotics, predominantly ciprofloxacin. Accrual was achieved within 3 years: 95% vs 88% of patients received the allocated 3-day vs 1-day antibiotic regimen. There were 0 urinary tract infections (0%) in the 1-day regimen and 3 urinary tract infections (0.7%) in the 3-day regimen, meeting our prespecified criterion for declaring the 1-day regimen to be noninferior. CONCLUSIONS: A clinically integrated trial using cluster randomization accrued rapidly with no important logistical problems and negligible burden on surgeons. If surgeons choose to prescribe empiric prophylactic antibiotics after catheter removal following RP, then the duration should not exceed 1 day.","Ehdaie B, Jibara G, Sjoberg DD, Laudone V, Eastham J, Touijer K, Scardino P, Donahue T, Goh A, Vickers A",J Urol. 2021 Sep;206(3):662-668. doi: 10.1097/JU.0000000000001845.

Old Drugs with New Tricks: Efficacy of Fluoroquinolones to Suppress Replication of Flaviviruses.,"Repurposing FDA-approved compounds could provide the fastest route to alleviate the burden of disease caused by flaviviruses. In this study, three fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, difloxacin and ciprofloxacin, curtailed replication of flaviviruses Zika (ZIKV), dengue (DENV), Langat (LGTV) and Modoc (MODV) in HEK-293 cells at low micromolar concentrations. Time-of-addition assays suggested that enoxacin suppressed ZIKV replication at an intermediate step in the virus life cycle, whereas ciprofloxacin and difloxacin had a wider window of efficacy. A129 mice infected with 1 x 10(5) plaque-forming units (pfu) ZIKV FSS13025 (n = 20) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (n = 11) on day 0 and treated with enoxacin at 10 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg or diluent orally twice daily on days 1-5 did not differ in weight change or virus titer in serum or brain. However, mice treated with enoxacin showed a significant, five-fold decrease in ZIKV titer in testes relative to controls. Mice infected with 1 x 10(2) pfu ZIKV (n = 13) or PBS (n = 13) on day 0 and treated with 15 mg/kg oral enoxacin or diluent twice daily pre-treatment and days 1-5 post-treatment also did not differ in weight and viral load in the serum, brain, and liver, but mice treated with enoxacin showed a significant, 2.5-fold decrease in ZIKV titer in testes relative to controls. ZIKV can be sexually transmitted, so reduction of titer in the testes by enoxacin should be further investigated.","Scroggs SLP, Andrade CC, Chinnasamy R, Azar SR, Schirtzinger EE, Garcia EI, Arterburn JB, Hanley KA, Rossi SL",Viruses. 2020 Sep 13;12(9):1022. doi: 10.3390/v12091022.,2020
Algorithms to Enhance Empiric Antimicrobial Choice for Outpatients With Afebrile Complicated Cystitis Reflects Importance of Status of the Urinary Tract and Patient Place of Residence.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine predictive factors for antimicrobial resistance patterns and to develop an antimicrobial treatment algorithm for afebrile outpatients presenting with complicated cystitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective, single-center, cross-sectional study of 2,891 outpatients with a diagnosed afebrile complicated cystitis from 2012 to 2018. For patients with confirmed urinary tract infection and antimicrobial sensitivities, univariate analyses and multivariable regression models were used to determine odds ratios for predicting resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, first-generation cephalosporin, and third-generation cephalosporin for the 2012-2016 data. Antimicrobial choice algorithms were created using 2012-2016 results and tested on 2017-2018 data. RESULTS: For afebrile outpatients presenting with complicated cystitis, overall prevalence of resistance for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, first-generation cephalosporin, and third-generation cephalosporin was 25.6%, 19.5%, 19.1%, 15.0%, and 6.9%, respectively. Consistent predictive factors influencing resistance to all 5 antimicrobials were patient place of residence (ZIP code), status of host urinary tract (complicated vs uncomplicated), and prior resistance to the antimicrobial. Resulting treatment algorithm for complicated cystitis (whether or not prior microbiologic data was available) outperformed real-life provider choice and our previously published algorithm for uncomplicated cystitis. CONCLUSION: Treatment algorithms for urinary tract infections are dependent on patient place of residence (ZIP code), status of the host urinary tract (complicated or uncomplicated), and prior urine culture resistance data. When using our complicated cystitis treatment algorithm regardless of uropathogen, our results outperformed real-life scenario provider choice and our prior published algorithm for uncomplicated cystitis, which can help guide empiric antimicrobial choice.","Cooley LF, Cohen JE, Chen L, Schaeffer AJ",Urology. 2020 Nov;145:127-133. doi: 10.1016/j.urology.2020.08.036.

"Antimicrobial susceptibility profile of Gonococcal isolates obtained from men presenting with urethral discharge in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: Implications for national syndromic treatment guideline.","BACKGROUND: Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococcus) is the etiologic agent for the sexually transmitted Infection gonorrhea, a disease with a significant global public health impact. The treatment regimen for gonorrhea has been changed frequently over the past few decades due to the organism's propensity for developing antibiotic resistance. This study investigated antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of quinolones, third-generation cephalosporin, and other relevant antimicrobials found in N. gonorrhoeae isolated from men presenting with urethral discharge at selected healthcare facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, with the aim of revising the national treatment regimen based on the information generated from this study. METHODS: A total of 599 male patients presenting with urethral discharge were included in the current study. Urethral discharge specimens were cultured on Modified Thayer Martin media and suspected gonococcal colonies were confirmed using Oxidase and Superoxol tests followed by identification through a commercial kit (API-NHR). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method using ciprofloxacin (5mug), ceftriaxone (30mug), cefixime (5mug), cefoxitin (30 mug), penicillin (10mug) and spectinomycin (100 mug) on enriched GC agar. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) was also carried out using concentration gradient strips (E-tests) of the same antimicrobial agents. RESULTS: The prevalence of gonococcal isolates in the current study was 69%. Out of the 361 gonococcal isolates, close to 68% were fluoroquinolone non-susceptible, with 60% resistant and 7% having an intermediate status. However, all tested isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone. In addition, all of the isolates have shown reduced non-susceptibility to spectinomycin and cefoxitin. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of gonococcal isolates in men presenting with urethral discharge at selected healthcare facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia was found to be high. The high level of fluoroquinolone resistance observed in gonococcal isolates recovered in this study necessitates revision of the national syndromic treatment guideline.","Fentaw S, Abubeker R, Asamene N, Assefa M, Bekele Y, Tigabu E",PLoS One. 2020 Jun 1;15(6):e0233753. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0233753. eCollection 2020.,2020
World Health Organization Global Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (WHO GASP): review of new data and evidence to inform international collaborative actions and research efforts.,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a serious public health problem, compromising the management and control of gonorrhoea globally. Resistance in N. gonorrhoeae to ceftriaxone, the last option for first-line empirical monotherapy of gonorrhoea, has been reported from many countries globally, and sporadic failures to cure especially pharyngeal gonorrhoea with ceftriaxone monotherapy and dual antimicrobial therapies (ceftriaxone plus azithromycin or doxycycline) have been confirmed in several countries. In 2018, the first gonococcal isolates with ceftriaxone resistance plus high-level azithromycin resistance were identified in England and Australia. The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (GASP) is essential to monitor AMR trends, identify emerging AMR and provide evidence for refinements of treatment guidelines and public health policy globally. Herein we describe the WHO GASP data from 67 countries in 2015-16, confirmed gonorrhoea treatment failures with ceftriaxone with or without azithromycin or doxycycline, and international collaborative actions and research efforts essential for the effective management and control of gonorrhoea. In most countries, resistance to ciprofloxacin is exceedingly high, azithromycin resistance is present and decreased susceptibility or resistance to ceftriaxone has emerged. Enhanced global collaborative actions are crucial for the control of gonorrhoea, including improved prevention, early diagnosis, treatment of index patient and partner (including test-of-cure), improved and expanded AMR surveillance (including surveillance of antimicrobial use and treatment failures), increased knowledge of correct antimicrobial use and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antimicrobials and effective drug regulations and prescription policies (including antimicrobial stewardship). Ultimately, rapid, accurate and affordable point-of-care diagnostic tests (ideally also predicting AMR and/or susceptibility), new therapeutic antimicrobials and, the only sustainable solution, gonococcal vaccine(s) are imperative.","Unemo M, Lahra MM, Cole M, Galarza P, Ndowa F, Martin I, Dillon JR, Ramon-Pardo P, Bolan G, Wi T",Sex Health. 2019 Sep;16(5):412-425. doi: 10.1071/SH19023.,2019
"Population Structure, Antibiotic Resistance, and Uropathogenicity of Klebsiella variicola.","Klebsiella variicola is a member of the Klebsiella genus and often misidentified as Klebsiella pneumoniae or Klebsiella quasipneumoniae The importance of K. pneumoniae human infections has been known; however, a dearth of relative knowledge exists for K. variicola Despite its growing clinical importance, comprehensive analyses of K. variicola population structure and mechanistic investigations of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes have not yet been performed. To address this, we utilized in silico, in vitro, and in vivo methods to study a cohort of K. variicola isolates and genomes. We found that the K. variicola population structure has two distant lineages composed of two and 143 genomes, respectively. Ten of 145 K. variicola genomes harbored carbapenem resistance genes, and 6/145 contained complete virulence operons. While the beta-lactam bla(LEN) and quinolone oqxAB antibiotic resistance genes were generally conserved within our institutional cohort, unexpectedly 11 isolates were nonresistant to the beta-lactam ampicillin and only one isolate was nonsusceptible to the quinolone ciprofloxacin. K. variicola isolates have variation in ability to cause urinary tract infections in a newly developed murine model, but importantly a strain had statistically significant higher bladder CFU than the model uropathogenic K. pneumoniae strain TOP52. Type 1 pilus and genomic identification of altered fim operon structure were associated with differences in bladder CFU for the tested strains. Nine newly reported types of pilus genes were discovered in the K. variicola pan-genome, including the first identified P-pilus in Klebsiella spp.IMPORTANCE Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are a growing public health threat. Understanding of pathogen relatedness and biology is imperative for tracking outbreaks and developing therapeutics. Here, we detail the phylogenetic structure of 145 K. variicola genomes from different continents. Our results have important clinical ramifications as high-risk antibiotic resistance genes are present in K. variicola genomes from a variety of geographic locations and as we demonstrate that K. variicola clinical isolates can establish higher bladder titers than K. pneumoniae Differential presence of these pilus genes inK. variicola isolates may indicate adaption for specific environmental niches. Therefore, due to the potential of multidrug resistance and pathogenic efficacy, identification of K. variicola and K. pneumoniae to a species level should be performed to optimally improve patient outcomes during infection. This work provides a foundation for our improved understanding of K. variicola biology and pathogenesis.","Potter RF, Lainhart W, Twentyman J, Wallace MA, Wang B, Burnham CA, Rosen DA, Dantas G",mBio. 2018 Dec 18;9(6):e02481-18. doi: 10.1128/mBio.02481-18.,2018
Ciprofloxacin-Resistant Bacteria on Pre-Prostate Biopsy Rectal Swab Culture: A Northwest Ohio Study.,"BACKGROUND: Ciprofloxacin is given to patients routinely prior to trans-rectal prostate biopsy. However bacterial resistance to this antibiotic has increased nationally resulting in increased infectious complications after prostate biopsy. In our study we aimed to quantify the percentage of older northwestern Ohio males harboring ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria in the rectal vault and to assess if resistance is increasing over time. METHODS: After Institutional Review Board approval, a retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent rectal swab culture within the Department of Urology at The University of Toledo Medical Center between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2015 was completed. Patient demographic data were collected including the presence of ciprofloxacin resistance bacteria. To test for significant differences, chi(2) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) analyses were completed where applicable. RESULTS: During the study period 311 swabs for resistant organisms were completed. The average age at time of swab was 64 (+/- 8.7 standard deviation [SD]) years old. Resistance rates were 13.2%, 13.8%, 19.5%, and 13.3% in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively. We found no statistically significant difference in resistances across years. Additionally, previous biopsy and age were not associated with ciprofloxacin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance to ciprofloxacin in the rectal vaults of older northwestern Ohio males is significant but appears to be stable over the study period. Previous biopsy and increased age do not appear to be risk factors for fluoroquinolone resistance. Given the relatively high rate of resistance in our population we recommend rectal swabs prior to prostate biopsy to assist in antibiotic agent choice.","Buck B, Fumo D, Arora K, Jain S, Sindhwani P",Surg Infect (Larchmt). 2018 Aug/Sep;19(6):614-617. doi: 10.1089/sur.2017.317.
